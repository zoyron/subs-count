## Dev cycle test

* This repository will contain the project that I made for the test of the recently ended dev cycle.
	* The dev cycle was a part of Pepcoding-BPIT placement program



### How to run the project?

- Clone this repository to your local machine
- `cd` to the newly created folder
- Run the command `npm install`, this will install all the required dependencies
- Run the command `node index` or `node index.js`



* This projects plots the live subscriber count on the terminal of the channel *Ed Sheeran*, since he is my favourite artist
	* Although,if you want to plot the subscriber count of any other artist or another youtube channel, just copy the URL of that channel to the variable **youtubeChannelUrl** inside the file `index.js`

> Adios! Happy plotting.
